# 💼 Workforce & Sales Intelligence Dashboard

## 📄 Project Description
This project is a dynamic **Workforce & Sales Intelligence Dashboard** developed to track sales revenue, unit volume, and employee performance. The dashboard transforms raw sales data into an interactive report, allowing management to filter performance by month and employee.

## ❓ Business Problem
Managing a sales team requires constant monitoring of both revenue and individual efficiency. Without a centralized tool, sales managers struggle to answer critical questions:
- **Productivity:** Which employees are meeting their targets?
- **Seasonality:** Which quarters generate the highest sales volume?
- **Product Mix:** Which product categories (Electronics vs. Furniture) drive the most revenue?

## 🎯 Dashboard Goal
The primary goal is to provide actionable intelligence to the sales management team, enabling them to:
1.  **Monitor KPIs:** Track Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, and Average Units per Employee.
2.  **Evaluate Performance:** Compare individual employee performance (e.g., EMP005 vs. others).
3.  **Analyze Trends:** Identify seasonal peaks (Q4) to manage inventory.

## ⚙️ Technical Workflow & Features
This dashboard was built using a structured data analysis process:

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before visualization, the raw data was processed to ensure accuracy:
- **Data Standardization:** Corrected date formats and ensured consistency in product category names.
- **Error Handling:** Removed duplicates and filtered out null/blank values to avoid calculation errors.
- **Formatting:** Organized columns (Employee ID, Date, Revenue, Units) for seamless pivot analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis (Pivot Tables)
- Used **Pivot Tables** to summarize large datasets into meaningful insights.
- Grouped sales data by **Quarters (Q1-Q4)** and **Product Categories** to calculate subtotals and averages.
- Calculated custom metrics like "Average Unit per Employee" using calculated fields.

### 3. Interactivity (Slicers)
- Integrated **Slicers** to make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly.
- **Month Slicer:** Allows users to filter data for specific months (Jan, Feb, etc.).
- **Employee Slicer:** Enables specific performance reviews for individual sales agents (e.g., filtering for "Christi Davis" or "Joe Lyn").

## 📊 Key Visuals & Insights
The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

* **KPI Cards:** Displaying Total Revenue (₹ 58,61,281) and Total Units Sold (4,064).
* **3D Pie Chart (Category Share):** Shows **Electronics (41%)** as the top-selling category.
* **Bar Charts:** Visualizes the "Average Units Sold by Employee," highlighting top performers like EMP005.
* **Quarterly Trend:** Identifies **Q4** as the peak sales season (1,507 units).

## 💡 Recommendations
1.  **Inventory Planning:** Stock up on Electronics and Stationery before Q4 to meet peak demand.
2.  **Training:** Organize knowledge-sharing sessions where top performers (EMP005) mentor those with lower sales volumes.
3.  **Q3 Strategy:** Implement promotional offers in Q3 to counteract the seasonal sales drop.
